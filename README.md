clash - a wiki in racket using scribble.
=====

I'm trying to build a very basic wiki using scribble as the wiki text! 
(to replace https://github.com/racket/racket/wiki)


### design

GET http(s)://server/filename.html    
 - file exist -> serve static file at specified path 
 - file missing -> edit form to create new page  
GET http(s)://server/filename.html?action=edit  
  -> serve edit page servlet that retrieves scribble source and puts it in a form
GET http(s)://server/filename <filename not found in #:server-root-path>  
  -> serve edit page adding parameters ?action=edit or maybe new   
POST form to http(s)://server/filename.html  
  -> update scribble source file & generate target html file in #:server-root-path and redirect to target html file at http(s)://server/filename.html  

the Scribble source and the generated html are in separate folders, 
````
;; folder to store html static files
(define page-root (build-path (current-directory) "html"))
;; folder to store scribble source (or other source format)
(define scribble-root (build-path (current-directory) "scribble"))
````
* filename.html is in  `#:extra-files-paths` aka `page-root`
* I'm trying to make it with plain old <form>s hence the use of POST (or can I use PUT or invent a verb in modern browsers?)  

### ToDO  
* users/authentication (openID?)
* git for versions (of the scribble files)
* history, scribble-diff, rollback
* An editor(in RacketScript), to provide a better UX than a form textbox 
* editing from DrRacket
* pollen instead of scribble (pollen allows undefined identifiers - which scribble doesn't - which woudl be useful in creating new pages in a wiki-like fashion)
